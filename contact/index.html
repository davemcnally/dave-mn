    <h1 class="contact_title">Hi! I’m Dave McNally</h1>
    <h2 class="contact_subtitle">I’m a freelance designer and front-end developer. It’s nice to meet you.</h2>

    <p>Assuming you’re here to learn more about me and my work, let’s get down to it. I am completely self-taught with no formal design training, having picked things up over the years I’ve been making websites. I’m constantly pushing myself to learn new things and improve upon what I already know.</p>

    <p>Clean interfaces, mobile &amp; performance are current passions of mine. JavaScript is my main focus for improvement at the moment. I know enough to get by with most front-end tasks but I'm no programmer. HTML &amp; CSS are old friends of mine. My development toolkit typically consists of Sass, Grunt, Git and Jekyll with Photoshop and Sketch covering design requirements. I like a mobile-first approach to development but with a focus on design at all sizes — design for the content, not for the screen size.</p>

    <p>Do you have a project in mind that I may be a good fit for? Let’s talk about it! You can either email me using the button below or you can call me on <span class="highlight">(+44) 01515287379</span></p>
