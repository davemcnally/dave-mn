    <h1 class="contact_title">Hi! I’m Dave McNally</h1>
    <h2 class="contact_subtitle">I’m a designer and front-end developer. It’s nice to meet you.</h2>

    <p>Assuming you’re here to learn more about me and my work, let’s get down to it. I am completely self-taught with no formal design training, having picked things up over the years I’ve been making websites. I’m constantly pushing myself to learn new things and improve upon what I already know.</p>

    <p>Clean interfaces, mobile &amp; performance are current passions of mine. JavaScript is my main focus for improvement at the moment. I know enough to get by with most front-end tasks but I'm no programmer. HTML &amp; CSS are old friends of mine. My development toolkit typically consists of Sass, Grunt, Git and Jekyll with Photoshop and Sketch covering design requirements. I like a mobile-first approach to development but with a focus on design at all sizes — design for the content, not for the screen size.</p>

    <p>If you have something you’d like me to work on, I would love to hear from you.</p>

    <p>In case you were wondering how this site is built or about anything on it, this section should clear that up. The site is built on <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/" title="Jekyll" onclick="trackOutboundLink('http://jekyllrb.com/'); return false;">Jekyll</a> which is an awesome static site generator. It is hosted at <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/?refcode=f3584d6e2bf0" title="Digital Ocean" onclick="trackOutboundLink('https://www.digitalocean.com/?refcode=f3584d6e2bf0'); return false;">Digital Ocean</a>.</p>

    <p>The build is handled by <a href="http://gruntjs.com/" title="Grunt" onclick="trackOutboundLink('http://gruntjs.com/'); return false;">Grunt</a> and the CSS is written in <a href="http://sass-lang.com/" title="Sass" onclick="trackOutboundLink('http://sass-lang.com/'); return false;">Sass</a>. The font being used is <a href="http://www.typography.com/fonts/gotham/overview/" title="Gotham" onclick="trackOutboundLink('http://www.typography.com/fonts/gotham/overview/'); return false;">Gotham</a> from <a href="http://www.typography.com/" title="Hoefler &amp; Co." onclick="trackOutboundLink('http://www.typography.com/'); return false;">Hoefler &amp; Co.</a> Background photographs on the homepage are from <a href="http://unsplash.com" title="Unsplash" onclick="trackOutboundLink('http://unsplash.com'); return false;">Unsplash</a>, apart from the top one which is mine.</p>
